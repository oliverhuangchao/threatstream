I have a <%aaa%> that one day this nation will rise up and live out true meaning of its <%bbb%> creed "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal." I have a <%aaa%> that one day on <%bbb%> red hills of Georgia, <%bbb%> sons of former slaves and <%bbb%> sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at <%bbb%> table of brotherhood. I have a <%aaa%> that one day even <%bbb%> state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with <%bbb%> heat of injustice, sweltering with <%bbb%> heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a <%aaa%> that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by <%bbb%> color of their skin but by <%bbb%> content of their character.
