First problem is solved using python-mysql api
I also add a connection to show how to run this py file if you need to run it
I created some values in the database

Run:
	python 1_book.py

I consider the following situation:
	1. something wrong for the spelling
	2. connect to the database
	3. the select value is None

-------------------------------------------------
Secdon problem I try to solve it using two methods:
**1. multi-thread
	I split all the contents using '.'. So each sentence will be operate using a thread.
	The dict is a share memory among all the threads, but no thread will change this dict
	And finally output the result into the a specific array based on the previous sequence
	Then join this array together
	Time:
		For each thread, the time should be O(n), just scan the passage once.
	Run:
		python 2_multithread.py

**2. Map Reduce
	firstly, put this dictionary in the cache, so every nodes can read it
	I write a pip line python instead to simulate the hadoop procedure

	Run:
		cat hello.txt | python 2_mapreduce_mapper.py | python 2_mapreduce_reducer.py	

------------------------------------------------
Third one is an algorithm problem. The solution is quite straigh forward.
basic idea:
1. firstly sort this array
2. Then choose a integer(x) from index 0 to the last
    a. use two pointers (a,b) starting from both sides to the mid (except x)
    b. add num[a],nums[b] and x together and compare to 0
        if bigger b--
        if smaller b++
        if equal store this output
3. do something corner case to accerlate this procedure

Run:
	python 3_sum_zero.py
